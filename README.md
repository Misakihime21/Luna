GENERAL IDEA

1. waking up in a dark room, calling for mom
lightswitch is to high to get
2. girl isn't alone - howling sounds and wind make her afraid
3. girl found a mom, but she can't wake her up. demons are about to get mom. 
lights must turn off at this point. table screamer
	'mom took her medicine because she is afraid. i must lit up the house so she wouldn't be afraid to wake up'
4. girl found strength in her to fight demons. 
	must find the broken piece for the basement thing to get the lights work again?
5. crouching and climbing environment to get the light and wake mom
6. mom helps a girl get to bed and turning lights on but girls telling her that she is fine in the dark

along the way you can see that mom is suffering from depression cuz her husband left her, or maybe died. but the girl is the greatest support for her
